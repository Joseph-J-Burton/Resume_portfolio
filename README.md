# Turtle Races Project  
## Project Description  
This is a project from the Udemy 100 days of Code: The complete Python Pro Bootcamp course by Dr. Angela Yu.  
The project is a simple game. The game is really just watching several colored turtle racing each other across the screen.  
The user interaction is guessing which color of turtle is going to win.  
The program runs each turtle independently by randomly selecting how far the turtle is going to move.  
The application file (Turtle_Races.exe) will alow this program to be run by others that may not have Python installed.

## Program versions
- Python 3.8

## Skills  
The Python program uses the Turtle class to create a screen, control screen items, and write messages.  
Not part of the code, but auto-py-to-exe was used to create a stand-alone file of the program.  

## Future Improvements
It would be nice to try a larger screen and add more interaction with the user.  
There is an error that happens when there is a tie between turtles. The script prints out twice or three times on top of each.
